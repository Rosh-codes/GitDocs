# Welcome to Your Git Documentation Site

This guide will help you get started with Git quickly. By the end of this page, youâ€™ll have Git installed and be ready to explore Git commands.

## 1. Installing Git

### Windows
1. Go to the [Git official website](https://git-scm.com/download/win).  
2. Download the installer and run it.  
3. Keep the default settings unless you have special requirements.  

### macOS
You can install Git using **Homebrew**:

```bash
brew install git
```

Alternatively, Git may already be installed on your Mac. You can check by running the command below.

### Linux
#### For Debian/Ubuntu:

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install git 
```
#### For Fedora/CentOS:
```bash
sudo dnf install git
```
## 2. Verify Git Installation
After installing, open a terminal or command prompt and run:

```bash
git --version 
```
You should see something like:

```text
git version 2.x.x 
```

This confirms Git is installed correctly.
